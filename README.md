**Project Introduction**
Black Friday is an annual shopping event that occurs on the Friday after Thanksgiving in the United States, which is celebrated on the fourth thursday of November. It is known for its massive discounts and deals on a wide range of products, making it one of the busiest shopping days of the year. Retailers often offer significant price reductions to attract shoppers both online and in stores. Many stores offer highly promoted sales on Black Friday and open very early, such as at midnight, or may even even start their sales at some time on Thanksgiving. The major challenge for a Retail store or eCommerce business is to choose product price such that they get maximum profit at the end of the sales. Our project deals with determining the product prices based on the historical retail store sales data. After generating the predictions, our model will help the retail store to decide the price of the products to earn more profits.
